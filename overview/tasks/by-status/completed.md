# Simulator library survey for DSGC compartmental modelling

## Motivation

`project/description.md` mentions NEURON as the canonical simulator but the researcher wants
to evaluate several libraries before committing. A bad simulator choice locks the project into
poor cable-model fidelity, slow parameter sweeps, or brittle tooling for months. A short
survey up front prevents this.

## Scope

Evaluate the following candidate libraries:

* NEURON (plus NEURON+Python bindings)
* NetPyNE (higher-level NEURON wrapper)
* Brian2 with cable-model extensions
* MOOSE
* Arbor

For each library, collect:

1. **Cable-model fidelity** — does it solve the full compartmental cable equation, support
   voltage-gated conductances in arbitrary compartments, and handle reconstructed morphologies
   (SWC, HOC, NeuroML)?
2. **Python ergonomics** — pure Python vs wrapped C++/MOD files, packaging on `uv`, quality of
   current documentation and examples.
3. **Speed and parallelism** — single-cell simulation speed and support for running large
   parameter sweeps.
4. **DSGC examples available** — whether any published DSGC or broader RGC compartmental model
   has been released in that library.
5. **Long-term maintenance** — last release, community activity, active maintainers.

## Approach

1. Run `/research-internet` to gather documentation, benchmarks, and user reports for each
   library.
2. Build a comparison table covering the five axes above.
3. Produce a single answer asset that recommends a **primary** simulator plus one **backup**,
   with explicit rationale.

## Expected Outputs

* One answer asset under `assets/answer/` summarising the library comparison and stating the
  primary plus backup recommendation.

## Compute and Budget

No external cost. Local LLM CLI and internet search only.

## Dependencies

None. Runs in parallel with t0002 and t0004.

## Verification Criteria

* The answer asset passes `verify_answer_asset.py`.
* The `## Answer` section states the primary and backup simulator in one or two sentences.
* The full answer includes the five-axis comparison table for every candidate library.

# Literature survey: compartmental models of DS retinal ganglion cells

## Motivation

This is the project's first research task. Before building any simulation we need a shared
knowledge base of what prior compartmental modelling work has done on direction-selective
retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) and what each of the project's five research questions (RQs)
looks like in the literature. The survey feeds every downstream task: the target tuning curve
generator (t0004) needs published tuning-curve shapes, the morphology download (t0005) needs a
shortlist of reconstructed DSGCs, and the later Na/K optimisation and active-vs-passive
dendrite experiments need candidate channel models and parameter ranges.

## Scope

Cover all five project research questions at survey level:

1. **RQ1 Na/K combinations** — how published DSGC and related RGC models parameterise somatic
   sodium and potassium conductances, and what combinations reproduce directional AP firing.
2. **RQ2 morphology sensitivity** — how branching pattern, dendritic diameter, and compartment
   length have been shown to affect DS tuning.
3. **RQ3 AMPA/GABA balance** — ratio and spatial distribution of excitatory and inhibitory
   inputs, and their measured effect on DS sharpness.
4. **RQ4 active vs passive dendrites** — evidence for dendritic voltage-gated conductances in
   DSGCs, and modelling studies that compare active with passive dendrites.
5. **RQ5 angle-to-AP-frequency tuning curves** — reported tuning-curve shapes, peak rates,
   half-widths, and null-direction suppression levels that can serve as optimisation targets.

Minimum breadth:

* Include the six references already listed in `project/description.md` (Barlow & Levick 1965,
  Hines & Carnevale 1997, Vaney/Sivyer/Taylor 2012, Poleg-Polsky & Diamond 2016,
  Oesch/Euler/Taylor 2005, Branco/Clark/Häusser 2010).
* Add at least 14 more papers found by internet search, spread across the five research
  questions.
* Prefer papers with a clearly described compartmental model, published morphology, or
  quantitative angle-to-rate measurements.

## Approach

1. Run `/research-papers` using the six seed references to build initial paper assets.
2. Run `/research-internet` to find additional compartmental DSGC modelling papers and any
   patch-clamp studies that report tuning curves.
3. Download each selected paper via `/download-paper` so every cited paper becomes a paper
   asset with a summary.
4. Produce one answer asset that synthesises, across all five RQs, what the existing
   literature says about how to structure the DSGC modelling problem and what numbers to aim
   for.

## Expected Outputs

* ~20 paper assets under `assets/paper/` (each with `details.json`, `summary.md`, and the
  paper file under `files/`).
* One answer asset under `assets/answer/` summarising how existing compartmental DSGC models
  structure the five research questions and what numerical targets they provide.

## Compute and Budget

No external cost. Local LLM CLI only; no paid APIs or remote machines.

## Dependencies

None. This is the first research task.

## Verification Criteria

* At least 20 paper assets pass `verify_paper_asset.py`.
* The answer asset passes `verify_answer_asset.py` and explicitly addresses each of the five
  research questions.
* `compare_literature.md` is not required for a pure literature survey.

# Brainstorm Results Session 1

## Objective

Run the first brainstorming session for the neuron-channels project, held immediately after
`/setup-project` completed. The goal is to translate `project/description.md` into a concrete
first wave of tasks that the researcher can execute autonomously.

## Context

The project is brand-new. After setup, the repository contains:

* `project/description.md` with five research questions about the electrophysiological basis
  of retinal direction selectivity, and success criteria centred on a modifiable compartmental
  model and a good fit to a target angle-to-AP-frequency tuning curve.
* `project/budget.json` with zero budget and no paid services.
* Eight project categories and four registered metrics (`tuning_curve_rmse` as the key
  metric).
* No existing tasks, suggestions, answers, or results.

## Session Outcome

The session produced four first-wave task folders, all with `status = not_started`:

* `t0002_literature_survey_dsgc_compartmental_models` — one broad literature survey covering
  all five research questions.
* `t0003_simulator_library_survey` — compare NEURON, NetPyNE, Brian2, MOOSE, Arbor, and pick a
  primary + backup simulator.
* `t0004_generate_target_tuning_curve` — analytically generate a canonical cosine-like target
  angle-to-AP-rate curve as the optimisation reference.
* `t0005_download_dsgc_morphology` — download a reconstructed DSGC morphology (depends on
  t0002).

T0002, t0003, and t0004 are independent and can run in parallel. T0005 waits on t0002's
morphology shortlist.

## Researcher Preferences Captured

* Target tuning curve will be simulated with a canonical cosine-like shape, not digitised from
  any published figure.
* The project will try several simulator libraries, not commit to NEURON alone up front.
* One big literature survey rather than several narrow ones.
* Autonomous execution; the researcher does not need to gate each task plan.
